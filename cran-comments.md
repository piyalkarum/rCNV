## R CMD check results

This is the first submission of the package

There were no ERRORs, or WARNINGs

There were tow NOTEs:

1. "Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
    CNV (3:37)
    VCF (7:61)"
    
  These are not misspelled words. They stand for CNV copy number variants, and variance call format, respectively.

2. "Maintainer field differs from that derived from Authors@R
  Maintainer: 'The package maintainer <piyalkarumail@yahoo.com>'
  Authors@R:  'Piyal Karunarathne <piyal.karunarathne@ebc.uu.se>'"
  
  This is on purpose. While my maintainer email ID is permanent, it is important for me to use the Authors@R email ID for publications of the package.
