# **rCNV: An R package for detecting copy number variants from SNPs data**
`r rCNV:::colorize("Piyal Karunarathne, Qiujie Zhou, and Pascal Milesi","dodgerblue")`


This tutorial provides a complete guide to detecting CNVs from SNPs data using rCNV package. This includes importing raw VCF files, filtering VCFs, normalization of read depth, categorization of SNPs into "deviants" and "non-deviants" from which  "duplicates" and "singlets" are then recognized. A brief workflow is presented in Fig 1. below.

![Fig. 1. Workflow of detecting CNVs with rCNV](workflow1.png){width=400}

All the data used in this tutorial is available either withing the package or from the GitHub repository at **link**.

We provide here a complete workflow of detecting CNVs from SNPs, starting with raw (unfiltered) VCF as in the number 1 of the workflow chart. However, if one believes that they have filtered VCFs for the parameters we've mentioned (see Fig.1 and sub-sections 1.2 and 1.3), they can start from the number 2 in the workflow shown above.

## 1. PRE-DETECTION
### 1.1 Importing data
|     Raw VCF files can be imported to rCNV R environment using the built-in function `readVCF()`. The imported vcf is stored as a data frame within a list. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Start by installing the package if you haven't already done so.  
# To install the CRAN version
install.packages(rCNV)

# Or if you would like to install the development version of the package
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE)) 
    install.packages("devtools") 
devtools::install_github("piyalkarum/rCNV", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

```{r, echo=T,eval=TRUE}
library(rCNV)
vcf.file.path <- paste0(path.package("rCNV"), "/example.raw.vcf.gz")
vcf <- readVCF(vcf.file.path,verbose = FALSE)

# This imports an example VCF file included in the package
```
```{r,eval=FALSE}
#print the first 10 rows and columns of the imported VCF
vcf$vcf[1:10,1:10]
```
```{r, echo=FALSE, tidy=TRUE,tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=60)}
vcf$vcf[1:6,c(1:7,9,10)]
```

### 1.2 Filtering VCF for missing data
|       The raw VCF files often contain missing data for both samples and SNPs. If retained, these samples and SNPs can introduce false positives and negatives to the analysis. Therefore, they must be removed based on a missing percentage. The function `get.miss()` determines the missing percentages in samples and SNPs and graphically visualize the missing ranges with 5% quantile values. We recommend removing samples and SNPs with missing percentages higher than 50%.
The following example demonstrates such filtering on Parrot Fish data from *McKinney et al. (2017)*.

```{r,echo=TRUE,eval=TRUE,fig.dim=c(6,4)}
#download the parrotfish data file from the following link to your working directory if you do not have the github folder
#https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=141-RRGKJaioGWuJxBOAz3D-nUmNI36LZ
fl<-"../testDATA/Parrotfish_sequenceReads.vcf.gz"
parrot<-readVCF(fl,verbose=F)
mss<-get.miss(parrot,verbose = F, plot=F)
```

This generates a list with missing percentage tables for SNPs and samples and a plot similar to Fig 1.2 where missing percentages are plotted. Users can also manually plot these percentages on their discretion. Further, if desired one type of missing percentage (i.e. per sample or per SNP) can be calculated separately by specifying the argument `type=` in the `get.miss()` function. See the help page of `get.miss()` for more information.

![Fig.1.2. Missing status of the VCF](get.miss.jpeg){width=80%}
```{r}
head(mss$perSample)
```

The plot shows that there are several samples with missing data for more than 50% of the SNPs. It is recommended to remove these before proceeding with further analysis. Removing them from the imported vcf file is just a matter of obtaining the columns (samples) for which missing percentage if >50%.

```{r}
dim(parrot$vcf)
sam<-which(mss$perSample$f_miss>0.5)+9 #here we determine the sample columns with f_miss>0.5 and add 9 to get the correct column number
parrot<-data.frame(parrot$vcf)[,-sam]
dim(parrot)
```
We have removed 5 samples that were undesired for the analysis due to their missing data.
Undesired SNPs can also be removed the same way; Hint: now they are in rows.

### 1.3 Assessing the relatedness among samples and heterozygosity withing

The function `relatedness()` in the rCNV package will generate the relatedness index between pairs of samples according to *Yang et al. (2010)*.
The output is a data frame with pairs of samples and the relatedness score *Ajk*. Please read *Yang et al. (2010)* for more information on the calculation of *Ajk*.

```{r,fig.dim=c(6,4),eval=FALSE}
rels<-relatedness(parrot)
head(rels)
```

From the relatedness plots, we can see that the relatedness in Parrot fish samples is low. We recommend removing one sample of the pairs with outlier values above 0.9.

![](relatedness.png){width=40%} ![](h.zygosity.png){width=40%}

Figure 1.3.a Relatedness among samples,b Heterozygosity in Parrotfish populations

Heterozygosity within populations can be calclated using `h.zygosity()` function.  

|   * NOTE: A list of populations corresponding to the samples must be provided in order to plot the heterozygosity among populations.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
pops<-substr(colnames(parrot)[-c(1:9)],1,2) #population codes (the first two letters of the sample names)
hz<-h.zygosity(parrot,pops=pops)
head(hz)
```
In figure 1.3.b, we can see that most of the individuals has a mean heterozygosity F<sub>IS</sub> close to 0.19, except for a few outliers. However, outliers with an F<sub>IS</sub> value below -0.2 is highly likely DNA contamination. Therefore, it is recommended to remove such samples.

## 1.4 Generating allele depth tables and normalized depth values

Allele read depth table is the main data set that will be used for the rest of the analysis. Therefore, having them generated and stored for later use will immensely save a lot of time. The function `hetTgen()` is especially dedicated for this purpose. Apart from generating filtered allele depth table for separate alleles (`info.type="AD"`), the function can also generate total allele depth (`info.type="AD-tot"`), genotype table (`info.type="GT"`), etc.. See the help page of `hetTgen()` for more formats.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
ad.tab<-hetTgen(parrot,info.type="AD")
ad.tab[1:10,1:6]
```

Table 1.4.0 Allele depth table (generated from a different data set than Parrot fish data)
```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable(ADtable[1:6,1:6],format="html")
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
#normalize depth table with cpm.normal()
ad.nor<-cpm.normal(ad.tab)
ad.nor[1:6,1:6]
```
Table 1.4.1 Normalized allele depth table
```{r, echo=FALSE,cache=FALSE}
ad.nor<-cpm.normal(ADtable,verbose = F, plot=F)
knitr::kable(ad.nor$AD[1:6,1:6],format = "html")
```
Compare the allele depth values between tables 1.4.0 and 1.4.1.

## 2. DETECTION
### 2.1 Generating allele information table
In this step, all the statistics necessary for detecting duplicates are calculated. They include the following:
a. Allele ratios (across all samples), b. Proportions of homo-/heterozygotes per SNP, c. Depth ratios (alternative/sum), d. Z-score, e. Chi-square significance, and f. excess of heterozygosity

Alternative allele ratio is calculated across all the samples from depth values;Proportion of homo/hetero-zygotes are also calculated all the samples per SNP; Depth ratio is calculated per individual per SNP by dividing the alternative allele depth value by the sum depth value of both alleles. This is calculated for both heterozygotes and homozygotes; Z-score per SNP is calculated according to the following equation:

![](eq.svg)

![](eq2.svg)

Where N is the total depth summed for all heterozygotes, N<sub>A</sub> is the depth of allele A summed for all the heterozygotes,
*P* is the occurrence probability of allele A in heterozygotes - for unbiased sequencing this is 0.5. `allele.info()` function calculates this for both 0.5 and biased probability using the ratio between reference and alternative alleles.

The Chi-squared values per SNP per sample were calculated using the following equation:
![](eq.chi.svg)

Where *N<sub>jk</sub>* is the total depth value of SNP *k* for individual *j*, *D<sub>jk</sub>* is the depth value of the alternative allele of SNP *k*, *P<sub>j</sub>* is the occurrence probability of alternative allele at SNP *k* in heterozygotes - in unbiased sequencing, this is 0.5.  

```{r,eval=FALSE}
A.info<-allele.info(ADtable, plot.allele.cov = TRUE)
head(A.info)
```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
head(alleleINF)
```

In addition to the above a-e parameters several other important statistics per sample per SNP is generated in the `allele.info()` output. See below.

### 2.2 Deviants detection

In this step, we use the allele information table generated in the previous step to detect deviant SNPs based different models, which then used in the next step with the appropriate test statistic to detect duplicates.
The rCNV function `dupGet()` delivers easy to pick model selections to detect deviant SNPs with a plotting (similar to HD plots in *McKinney et al. 2017*) option to visualize the detection.


```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Run this code for a demonstration of the detection
dvs<-dupGet(alleleINF)
```


The detection of deviant SNPs is based on the **heterozygosity** within populations (or among all samples) and **allelic ratios** within such heterozygotes.
As such, `dupGet()` function implements three methods to flag the deviant alleles; They are a) Excess of heterozygotes and b) Heterozygote SNPs that do not follow normal Z distribution, and c) Heterozygote SNPs that do not follow normal chi-square distribution.

|   The proportion of heterozygotes in a population according to HWE is 2pq where as homozygotes is q<sup>2</sup>. In deviant SNPs heterozygozity is expected to be higher indicating excess of heterozygosity and thus flagged as deviant/putative-duplicates.

|   In non-duplicated alleles (singlets), median allele ratio must be ~0.5, however, in deviants it varies between 1:3 and 3:1. These SNP deviants are also flagged as putative duplicates. To determine the deviation, we use the Z-score values and Chi-square significance calculated in the previous step.

|   **NOTE: users can select the occurrence probability of the alternative allele based on the sequencing method and the probe bias therein. 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
deviants<-dupGet(alleleINF,test = c("z.all","chi.all"),plot=TRUE,verbose = TRUE)
head(deviants)
```
```{r,echo=FALSE}
deviants<-dupGet(alleleINF,plot=FALSE,verbose = FALSE)
head(deviants)
```

The function also plots the deviants with Allele median ratio Vs Proportion of Heterozygotes to visualize and validate the detection by the user. Users can also plot the detection separately with the output of `dupGet()` using `dup.plot()` fucntion.

![Fig 2.1 Median allele ratio Vs Prop. of Heterozygotes with deviant alleles](devPlot.png){width=400}

### 2.3 Filtering putative duplicates
Putative duplicates are filtered from the deviant SNPs using a combination of at least two statistics used in deviant detection. i.e., the SNPs that are detected by the intersection between excess of heterozygotes, Z-score distribution and Chi-square distribution are flagged as putative duplicated. The users can pick a range of optimal statistics (e.g. `z.all`,`chi.all`,`z.05`,`chi.05`, etc.) depending on the nature (also sequencing technology) of the underlying data. The function `cnv()` is dedicated for this purpose.

```{r eval=FALSE}
CV<-cnv(alleleINF, test=c("z.05","chi.05"))
# see the difference between deviants and duplicates
table(deviants$dup.stat)
table(CV$dup.stat)
```

![Fig 2.1 Median allele ratio Vs Prop. of Heterozygotes with putative duplicates](dupPlot.png){width=400}

```{r eval=TRUE,echo=FALSE}
CV<-cnv(alleleINF, test=c("z.05","chi.05"),verbose = F,plot = F)
# see the difference between deviants and duplicates
table(deviants$dup.stat)
table(CV$dup.stat)
```
