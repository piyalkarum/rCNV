\title{Get sequencing quality statistics of raw VCF files (with GatK generated vcf files only)}
\usage{
vcf.stat(vcf, plot = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{vcf}{an imported vcf file in data.frame or matrix format using "readVCF"}

\item{plot}{logical. Whether to plot the (12) parameters}

\item{...}{other arguments passed on to \link[graphics]{plot} (e.g. col,border)}
}
\value{
returns a data frame with quality parameters from the info. field of the vcf\n
QUAL   The Phred-scaled probability that a REF/ALT polymorphism exists at this site given sequencing data\n
AC     Allele count\n
AF     Allele frequencey\n
DP     unfiltered depth\n
MQ     .....\n
QD     QualByDepth - This is the variant confidence (from the QUAL field) divided by the unfiltered depth of non-hom-ref samples\n
FS     FisherStrand - This is the Phred-scaled probability that there is strand bias at the site\n
SOR    StrandOddsRatio - This is another way to estimate strand bias using a test similar to the symmetric odds ratio test\n
MQ     RMSMappingQuality - This is the root mean square mapping quality over all the reads at the site\n
MQRankSum  MappingQualityRankSumTest - This is the u-based z-approximation from the Rank Sum Test for mapping qualities\n
ReadPosRankSum ReadPosRankSumTest - This is the u-based z-approximation from the Rank Sum Test for site position within reads\n

\description{
This function will generate a table similar to VariantsToTable option in GatK from raw vcf files for filtering purposes. The fucntion will aslo plot all the parameters (see details & values).
